# Mini-Compiler-Python-Interpreter
This project, “Mini Compiler – Python Interpreter”, is a simplified compiler that compiles and interprets a subset of the Python programming language. It includes core components like a lexer, parser, AST nodes, and an interpreter. A GUI is also developed to allow users to write and run Python code interactively.
