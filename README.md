# Mini-Compiler-Python-Interpreter
This project, “Mini Compiler – Python Interpreter”, is a simplified compiler that compiles and interprets a subset of the Python programming language. It includes core components like a lexer, parser, AST nodes, and an interpreter—all built in Python. A basic GUI is also developed to allow users to write and run Python code interactively. Currently, the compiler supports limited features such as variable handling, arithmetic operations, comments reading, basic iteration methods, and print statements. Future improvements will expand its functionality to support more Python syntax and advanced compiler features.

# File Descriptions
lexer1.py
This file performs lexical analysis. It scans the user's input code and breaks it into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, and symbols using regular expressions.

my_parser1.py
Handles syntax analysis. It parses the list of tokens generated by the lexer and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based on grammar rules defined for the subset of Python supported.

ast_nodes1.py
Defines various AST node classes that represent elements of the code like variables, binary operations, assignments, and print statements. These nodes form the structure of the parsed program.

interpreter1.py
Traverses the AST and executes the corresponding actions. It simulates a Python interpreter by evaluating expressions and performing operations such as variable assignment and printing output.

test_script.py
Acts as the main entry point for the project. It integrates the GUI where users can write and run Python code, and connects all backend components (lexer, parser, AST, interpreter) to compile and execute the code in real time.
