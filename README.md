# Mini-Compiler-Python-Interpreter
This project, “Mini Compiler – Python Interpreter”, is a simplified compiler that compiles and interprets a subset of the Python programming language. It includes core components like a lexer, parser, AST nodes, and an interpreter—all built in Python. A basic GUI is also developed to allow users to write and run Python code interactively. Currently, the compiler supports limited features such as variable handling, arithmetic operations, comments reading, basic iteration methods, and print statements. Future improvements will expand its functionality to support more Python syntax and advanced compiler features.
